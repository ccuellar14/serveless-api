Create custom domain names that your lambda can deploy to with serverless. Allows for base path mapping when deploying and deletion of domain names.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before starting:
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm)
* [serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)

The IAM role that is deploying the lambda will need the following permissions:
```
acm:ListCertificates                *
apigateway:GET                      /domainnames/* 
apigateway:DELETE                   /domainnames/*
apigateway:POST                     /domainnames
cloudfront:UpdateDistribution       *
route53:ListHostedZones             *
route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets    hostedzone/{HostedZoneId}
route53:GetHostedZone               hostedzone/{HostedZoneId}
route53:ListResourceRecordSets      hostedzone/{HostedZoneId}
```
### CloudFormation
Alternatively you can generate an least privileged IAM Managed Policy for deployment with this:

[deployment policy cloudformation template](scripts/cloudformation/serverless-domain-manager-deploy-policy.yaml)

## Installing
```
# From npm (recommended)
npm install serverless-domain-manager

# From github
npm install https://github.com/amplify-education/serverless-domain-manager.git
```

Then make the following edits to your serverless.yaml file:
```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-domain-manager

custom:
  customDomain:
    basePath:
    domainName:
    stage:
    certificateName:
    createRoute53Record: true
```
For example:
```yaml
custom:
  customDomain:
    basePath: "dev"
    domainName: serverless.foo.com
    stage: dev
```
If certificateName is not provided, the certificate will be chosen using the domain name.
If certificateName is blank, an error will be thrown.
If createRoute53Record is blank or not provided, it defaults to true.
Stage is optional, and if not specified will default to the user-provided stage option, or the
stage specified in the provider section of serverless.yaml (Serverless defaults to 'dev' if this
is unset).

## Running

To create the custom domain:
```
serverless create_domain
```

To deploy with the custom domain:
```
severless deploy
```

To remove the created custom domain:
```
serverless delete_domain
```
# How it works
Creating the custom domain takes advantage of Amazon's Certificate Manager to assign a certificate to the given domain name. Based on already created certificate names, the plugin will search for the certificate that resembles the custom domain's name the most and assign the ARN to that domain name. The plugin then creates the proper CNAMEs for the domain through Route 53. Once the domain name is set it takes up to 40 minutes before it is initialized. After the certificate is initialized, `sls deploy` will create the base path mapping and assign the lambda to the custom domain name through Cloudfront.

## Running Tests
To run the test:
```
npm test
```
All tests should pass.

If there is an error update the node_module inside the serverless-vpc-discovery folder:
```
npm install
```

# Known Issues
* (5/23/2017) CloudFormation does not support changing the base path from empty to something or vice a versa. You must run `sls remove` to remove the base path mapping.
* (5/23/2017) Amazon Certificate Manager only allows certificates from the `us-east-1` region certificates for use with CloudFront, and by extension, API Gateway Custom Domains (Results in a BadRequestException: Certificate name must be specified...).
